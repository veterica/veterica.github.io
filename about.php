<p class="auto-style5">About Us:</p>
<p class="auto-style6">We are a 2010 revival, made in&nbsp; March 09 2018 by 
Nutgear. Nothing special, the website has been remade 5 times, current becoming 
this one.</p>
<p class="auto-style5">Our History:</p>
<p class="auto-style6">We are made in March 09 2018 by Nutgear, as we said in 
"About Us", our first client was 2007, used for SVeterica, later on in late 
March, we moved to being multiplayer. First multiplayer attempt was 2008, second 
attempt was succesful with a somewhat suspicious 2010, until&nbsp; we made more 
clients, like 2007, 2006 and 2008E. During the removal of 2010 due to script 
errors and criticism, we had only 2 clients 2007 and 2008E. Later, 2006 was 
added and removed, 2009 added and hats added, catalog wipeout and 2009 replaced 
with 2010. This is the part where Veterica became a 2010 revival, we made the 
first catalog hat after wipeout. The "Red Baseball Cap". Later, new hats are 
added, new hat types implemented. During the development of the present website, 
hat types has changed their names and the Catalog looks different from what it 
was.</p>
